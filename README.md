walidoumechtak: why here we return Promise<type> why we don't just return or do () : Type, with out Promise?

GitHub Copilot: In this code, the methods are returning [`Promise<Type>`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A215%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2015.iterable.d.ts") instead of just `Type` because they are asynchronous functions. 

When a function is marked as `async`, it means that it will return a [`Promise`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A215%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2015.iterable.d.ts"). By returning a [`Promise`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A215%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2015.iterable.d.ts"), the function allows the caller to handle the result asynchronously using `async/await` or `.then()` syntax.

Returning a [`Promise`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A215%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2015.iterable.d.ts") is useful when the function performs asynchronous operations, such as making API calls, querying a database, or reading/writing files. These operations may take some time to complete, so returning a [`Promise`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A215%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2015.iterable.d.ts") allows the caller to wait for the result without blocking the execution of other code.

By returning [`Promise<Type>`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A215%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2015.iterable.d.ts"), the function is indicating that it will eventually resolve to a value of type `Type`. This allows the caller to handle the result appropriately, whether it's a successful value or an error.

If the methods in this code were to return `Type` directly instead of [`Promise<Type>`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A215%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2015.iterable.d.ts"), it would imply that the operations are synchronous and will immediately return the result. However, if the operations inside the methods are actually asynchronous, returning `Type` directly would be misleading and could lead to unexpected behavior.

In summary, returning [`Promise<Type>`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fusr%2Fshare%2Fcode%2Fresources%2Fapp%2Fextensions%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es2015.iterable.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A215%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2015.iterable.d.ts") from asynchronous functions is a way to indicate that the function performs asynchronous operations and allows the caller to handle the result asynchronously.

walidoumechtak: can you explain step by step what is the role of this useEffect?

GitHub Copilot: Certainly! Let's break down the role of this [`useEffect`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%2540types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2030%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts") step by step:

1. The [`useEffect`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%2540types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2030%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts") hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It allows you to run code in response to certain events or conditions.

2. In this case, the [`useEffect`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%2540types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2030%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts") hook is being used to handle the loading and cleanup of a video element.

3. The code inside the [`useEffect`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%2540types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2030%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts") hook is executed when the component is mounted (i.e., rendered for the first time) and whenever the dependencies specified in the second argument of the [`useEffect`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%2540types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2030%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts") hook change. In this case, the dependencies are `[loaded, setIsloaded]`, which means the code will run whenever the [`loaded`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A70%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/src/pages/Post.tsx") or [`setIsloaded`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A70%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/src/pages/Post.tsx") values change.

4. Inside the [`useEffect`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%2540types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Freact%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2030%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts") hook, a function named [`handleLoadedData`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A111%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "frontend/src/pages/Post.tsx") is defined. This function is responsible for playing the video, setting a timeout to update the `isLoaded` state after 300 milliseconds, and is later used as an event listener.

5. The [`videoRef`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A117%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "frontend/src/pages/Post.tsx") variable is assigned the value of [`video.current`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A107%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/src/pages/Post.tsx"). Here, [`video`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDesktop%2Ftiktok_clone%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2FPost.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A107%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "frontend/src/pages/Post.tsx") is a ref that references the video element in the component.
